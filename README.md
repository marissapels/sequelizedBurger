# sequelizedBurger

This application functions just the same as the previously-completed Eat-da-Burger application. The only difference is that sequelizedBurger uses Sequelize to create and update the information in the SQL database.

Eat-da-Burger uses Object Relational Mapping (ORM) and a Model-View-Controller structure to connect Node.js code to a SQL database and Handlebars-based User Interface. The user can create a burger and then devour it!
